FOMO

INTRODUCTION AND SPECIFICATIONS FOMO is a fun web application that helps coders alleviate their fear of missing out while they’re coding. This application takes the information on a user’s coding activity on Github and queries the music events that they’ve missed based on their commit times via Tumblr API. Once the events are queried, a list of music events are displayed, which the user can click on to see more information. When an event is clicked, the users are given information about albums, track, artists and playlists regarding the music event, which is drawn using the Spotify’s API. Now the users can still code away without missing out on any concerts that are taking place!
